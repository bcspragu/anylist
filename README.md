# (Br)AnyList

(Br)AnyList is a mobile-friendly (mobile-only?) frontend for viewing and
modifying lists on AnyList.

The backend code is heavily inspired by https://github.com/codetheweb/anylist

It looks like this:

## The Extremely Mundane Story

I received an AnyList subscription as a Christmas gift, but I'm not a big fan
of downloading apps. The AnyList website is nice, but it doesn't work well on
mobile. My needs are simple, a Google Keep-like add/view/remove items from a
list type of functionality. That's what this project will attempt to provide.

## What Works

The basics: Authentication, loading list data, adding/removing/checking/
unchecking items. Checked items go to the end.

## What Doesn't Work

Anything else. Specifically:

- [ ] Any sort of live updating
- [ ] Any sort of reordering
- [ ] Categories
- [ ] Prices
- [ ] Photos

With the exception of live updating, I probably won't even attempt to add any
other functionality.
