# (Br)AnyList

(Br)AnyList is a mobile-friendly (mobile-only?) frontend for viewing and
modifying lists on AnyList.

The backend code is heavily inspired by https://github.com/codetheweb/anylist

## The Extremely Mundane Story

I received an AnyList subscription as a Christmas gift, but I'm not a big fan
of downloading apps. The AnyList website is nice, but it doesn't work well on
mobile. My needs are simple, a Google Keep-like add/view/remove items from a
list type of functionality. That's what this project will attempt to provide.

## What Works

Authentication, loading list data, and basic (read-only) frontend functionality.

## What Doesn't Work

Everything else. Specifically:

- [ ] Adding list items
- [ ] Removing list items
- [ ] Moving done items to the end
- [ ] Any sort of live updating
